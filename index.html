                <p>The project Luminary aims to optimize the learning-curve, minimize the instructor interaction and accelerate the self-learning process with the help of Generative AI and digitalization.  </p>
<p>The platform analyzes the students and creates questions based on the topics they struggle with, therefore one of the important benefits is the ability for students to recognize their areas of weakness. </p>
<p>In detail, the student will be able to test him/herself with the AI-generated questions based on the wrong answers analyzed in the uploaded questions. With targeted practice, this individualized method helps students strengthen their areas of weakness and reinforces what they have learned. </p>
<p>Our platform supports user-generated content by allowing users to submit presentations or articles that are carefully examined to provide personalized learning materials. Using advanced algorithms, the site creates brief notes and sample questions based on supplied information. This way, students have the opportunity to use our system in their daily study routine. </p>
 <p>Our project presents an enhanced learning environment developed to improve students' educational experience.</p>
